                    <p>
                        Dear Parent,<br>Thank you for attending a Soccerkids Coaching session. Soccerkids provides all individual and team coaching for Essex Rangers F.C.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are looking to form our new Essex Rangers U7 teams for the coming season.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We realise that the season in the echo league will not start until September however we as a club are looking to form the teams as soon as possible so the boys can get to know their teammates and have lots of game time.</p>
                    <p>
                        We would like to gauge the commitment form parents and we are asking all parents who`s child is currently in School year 1 to complete a form informing us that he wants to be included in any plans we have for tournaments competitions and planned practise
                        or matches throughout the summer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We realise people need some time off for holidays etc however we want to make sure we are ahead of the game when forming our teams. We are looking for 28 players who will be split into 4 squads of 7.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We feel currently we have roughly half of the required numbers so we will embark on a schools and social media recruitment drive assist with this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are looking to arrange kits for the boys as early as April, so we look the part. We will arrange a Sunday morning practise where we will meet to discuss and deal with any questions you may have.
                    </p>
